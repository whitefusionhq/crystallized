# ❄️ Crystallized

**Crystallized** is a collection of quality-of-life DX enhancements to Lit 2 or "vanilla" web components, inspired in part by [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev). Crystallized includes:

* `DeclarativeActionsController` - lets you add action attributes to elements as a way of providing declarative event handlers.

* `TargetsController` - lets you easily query child nodes in DOM using either selectors or explicit attribute-based identifies.

Crystallized can be used with any ESM bundler as well as directly in buildless HTML using `script type="module"`.

Crystallized works great as a spice on top of server-rendered markup originating from backend frameworks like [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) or static sites generators like [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com)—providing features not normally found in web component libraries that assume they're only concerned with client-rendered markup and event handling.

You can build an entire suite of reactive frontend components just with Crystallized, along with a general strategy to enhance your site with a variety of emerging [web components](https://github.com/topics/web-components) and component libraries ([Shoelace](https://shoelace.style) for example).
